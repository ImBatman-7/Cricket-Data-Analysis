**1. Introduction:**

The T20 World Cup is a major cricketing event showcasing the best players in the world. This project analyzed data from the 2022 T20 World Cup to identify the top performers and construct the optimal team based on specific criteria.

**2. Objective:**

    Analyze player performance data from the 2022 T20 World Cup.
    Develop criteria to identify top performers for different roles (openers, middle-order, all-rounders, spinners, fast bowlers).
    Build a virtual "best team" based on performance metrics and role-specific requirements.
    Visualize player performance data and team composition using Power BI.

**3. Module Description:**

    **Data Collection:** Used Bright Data web scraping tool to extract match summaries, player batting and bowling statistics, and player information from a cricket website.
    
    **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Transformed scraped data into separate Excel files and further cleaned and manipulated data using Jupyter Notebook and Excel.
    
    **Data Analysis:** Defined criteria for each player role (e.g., average, strike rate, position for openers) and filtered players based on those criteria.
    
    **Team Building: **Selected top performers for each role to create the virtual "best team."

    **Data Visualization:** Created Power BI dashboards with various charts, graphs, and tables to visualize player performance and team composition.
